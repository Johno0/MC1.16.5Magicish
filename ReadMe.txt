INSTRUCTIONS YES YES! (this is entirely for windows)

1: Check you have java. If you already know you hab then this will be fine. 
	Can check by opening a command prompt and typing "java -version" this will give the version of java you have
	or it will say the java command doesn't exist.
	if you don't there is a java installer included, run that (this is java8)
	Command prompt can be opened from the windows search bar typing command prompt

2: Check you have minecraft installed, ideally make sure you have run it at least once

3: Run "forge-1.16.5-installer" checking install forge, direct it to your mincraft folder if needed

4: Run minecraft with forge
	To do this open the minecraft launcher in the bottom left you should see a forge release as the profile name

5: If it fails first time try again, once it launches fully close it.

6: Open your minecraft directory, this will be in the roaming folder. It can also be found in the installations tab
	in the minecraft launcher. Hover over the forge profile and click to file to open such.
	copy the contents of "mods" in this folder into the mods folder in you minecraft directory.
	close the file explorer
	
EXTRA: Also copy the kubejs folder into the .minecraft directory

7: Check how much RAM your machine has (modded minecraft needs many much)
	open task manager (ctr shift esc) click performance on the top bar then the memory tab.
	in the top right you will see a number wich could be in the range of 4.0 GB - 124.0 GB
	THIS IS HOW MUCH RAM YOU HAVE.

8: Allocate more ram to minecraft java vm.
	in the installation tab in the minecraft launcher hover over the forge profile and click the three dots then edit.
	next click more options at the bottom and scroll down to "JVM ARGUMENTS"
	it will contain a big thing beginning with "-Xmx1G"
	change the 1 to be a different number based off of how much RAM you have
	Minimum is 4, recommended is 6. This number should not exceed how much ram your machine has
	if it is near that number then it's likely you should not be running many other programs while playing.
	"-Xmx1G" should now look something like "-Xmx8G"
	press save

9: Launch minecraft. 
	This will take a while, I would suggest to leave it to do it's thing. It may stop responding while loading.
	That is fine you only need to worry if it crashes and closes.

10: Connect to server IP is: 82.37.148.124:25565

In the event of an error which you cannot solve yourself ask others for help.
If that don't work I guess you can @ me
